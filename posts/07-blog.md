# The Effect of COVID
## October 25, 2020

In 2017, Achen and Bartel famously wrote about the effects of shark attacks on elections in their book entitled [*Democracy For Realists*](https://hollis.harvard.edu/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=TN_cdi_askewsholts_vlebooks_9781400888740&context=PC&vid=HVD2&search_scope=everything&tab=everything&lang=en_US). Such pursuits, on their face, appear trivial. How would shark attacks affect election outcomes? Why is that even a question worth asking? When thinking more broadly, it becomes clear. Natural disasters, despite their randomness, necessitate political action. For example, [Healy et al. (2020)](https://hollis.harvard.edu/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=TN_cdi_crossref_primary_10_1561_100_00009057&context=PC&vid=HVD2&search_scope=everything&tab=everything&lang=en_US) looks at instances of tornadoes. Depending on the political response (state of emergency, aid, etc.), the incumbent's vote share was affected. Therefore, as the random necessitates action, it becomes political.

2020 has had one of the greatest shocks ever during a presidential election: COVID. While random, it has seemingly had an outsized effect on the election. This week, I sought to quantify that effect. How does an increase in deaths in a state affect general election poll numbers for President Trump? What about an increase in testing? It should be noted that the causal relationships here is not clear. It cannot be assumed that COVID is the only issue affecting the minds of voters. Nevertheless, we can look at the association between the two.

First, I looked at an increase in COVID deaths by state with the reasoning that people dying within your state due to the pandemic may affect your feelings about the current administration. The x-axis depicts the increase in COVID deaths in a given week. The x-axis is also scaled using log2 in order to better display the points. Due to the variability in COVID deaths by state, the associations otherwise would not have been otherwise visible in all states. The y-axis shows the mean poll number from the next week as to allow for public opinion to catch up. This set of 16 states is not random. They are the states with enough polling data and data on COVID deaths to depict some sort of relationship with at least 10 observations—representing 10 different weeks.

Second, I looked at an increase in COVID testing by state with the reasoning that testing within your state, a sign of a political response to the pandemic, may affect your feelings about the current administration. The x-axis depicts the increase in COVID tests in hundreds in a given week. The x-axis is also scaled using log10 in order to better display the points. Due to the variability in COVID deaths by state, the associations otherwise would not have been otherwise visible in all states. The y-axis shows the mean poll number from the next week as to allow for public opinion to catch up. This set of 11 states is not random. They are the states with enough polling data and data on testing volume to depict some sort of relationship with at least 10 observations—representing 10 different weeks.

If I am working for Biden, I cannot let another 2016 happen. [She lost by a narrow margin of 13,000 votes](https://www.mlive.com/politics/2016/11/how_did_donald_trump_win_michi.html). She lost key counties outside of the Detroit stronghold, and Detroit voters didn't show up. To quote mlive, ["Compared to Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, Clinton underperformed in counties such as Wayne and Genesee, which have Michigan's largest African-American communities. Those two counties alone gave Obama a net gain of 439,202 votes compared to 308,270 for Clinton in 2016."](https://www.mlive.com/politics/2016/11/how_did_donald_trump_win_michi.html) She could not get out the vote. [Clinton's ground game was therefore criticized in Michigan](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/michigan-hillary-clinton-trump-232547) and the Rust Belt in general. Nevertheless, she only had one less field office than Obama in 2012, and the locations were relatively the same. Despite what confounding variables there may be, Biden must double down in key areas and actually get out the vote. Some blue strongholds almost flipped in 2016 and only had one field office such as Marquette, Muskegon, Kalamazoo, and Lansing. Biden should double or triple the number of field offices in those higher population areas. Next, almost all other forces should be focused on southeastern Michigan—where the population is. Clinton lost by 13,000 but lost 130,000 votes in that area compared to Obama. Biden could need only 10 percent, but that ten percent will be crucial.

Is an increase in COVID deaths associated with lower poll numbers for Trump? Is an increase in COVID testing associated with higher numbers? All in all, the jury is still out. While the Montana, Kentucky, Maine, and Iowa slopes suggest that there is an inverse relationship between COVID deaths and Trump poll numbers, all other slopes hover close to zero including all of those for testing volume. In order for me to include COVID data in my election prediction, I will have to further tweak my models and determine a more robust relationship. Nevertheless, due to the current lack of a concrete relationship, I doubt that I will include COVID data for all states within my final prediction model.
